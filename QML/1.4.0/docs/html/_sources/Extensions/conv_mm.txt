(S)CONV_MM
=================
Single precision CONV_MM.

Description
-----------
Takes an image and a set of filters and performs a convolution using matrix multiplication.
The image must be stored in channel major format.

Extension Interface
-------------------
.. code-block:: c

  void sconv_mm(const bool biased, const float* src, const qml_int srcWidth,
                const qml_int srcHeight, const qml_int srcNumChannels,
                const float* filters, const qml_int numFilters,
                const qml_int filterX, const qml_int filterY, const qml_int padLeft,
                const qml_int padTop, const qml_int strideX, const qml_int strideY,
                float* output, const qml_int outputWidth, const qml_int outputHeight);
